# Anna-Master-Project
This is the repository from the Talavera-López Lab to all analyses related to the cellular circuits from scRNA-Seq in colorectal cancer.

The three questions that are studied in this analysis:
1. Investigate the cellular circuits associated with cell-cell interactions between progenitor,  stromal and myeloid cells in the gut during colorectal cancer. An extension of these questions will be how they compare with fetal development and across species.

2. Comparative analysis of CCI between progenitors, stromal and myeloid cells in colorectal cancer and other solid cancers (brain cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, etc.). 

3. Analyze the interaction of CSC with immune cells and divide these interactions into two categories: interactions to escape immunosurveillance and interactions to activate and “make” immune cells more tumorigenic
